This site borrows its name from an essential bit of doublespeak in common use among golfers across the pond. Topped drive into gorse? Fanned five-iron off planet? Missed a putt no longer than your shoe? "Oh...unlucky."

Translation: "That was fucking dreadful."

And with that in mind...welcome! By way of introduction, my name is Thomas Dunne. I've been a full-time golf writer since 2003 for a variety of publications including _Departures, Travel + Leisure Golf, LINKS,_ and many more. But I have no intention of acting professional here. This is a place for my distractions and obsessions and dad jokes, with some golf mixed in for fun along the way. I'm here to entertain myself. Unlucky you...
